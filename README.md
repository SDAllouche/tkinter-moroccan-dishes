# Traditional Moroccan dishes

Moroccan cuisine is considered one of the most diverse cuisines in the world. Indeed, for centuries, Morocco has been very interactive with other nations and has embraced and integrated many different cultural influences, not only in its food, but also in its art, music and literature. 

In this mini-project we have described the different Moroccan dishes in two languages (French, English), and we have used a graphic interface to make the reading easier and not boring. For this purpose we used a python library called Tkinter.

This is some screenshots of the application :
